        intro="""A new synthesis method of highly calibrated CsPbBr3 nanocrystals perovskites is described and analyzed using High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. This new method based on soft chemistry leads to the large-scale production of nanocrystals. Such monodisperse nanocrystals allow for the deposition of homogeneous films which provides new opportunities for the next generation of optoelectronic devices.""",
